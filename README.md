# IDS_Implementation_In_SCADA_using_ML

1. Defined the vision and roadmap for a machine learning-based intrusion detection
system, enhancing the cybersecurity of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to meet critical infrastructure security requirements.

2. Led the design and implementation of a two-level classification framework, integrating Bloom Filters and a Voting Classifier (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
to improve accuracy and decision-making.

3. Achieved 99.5 percentage detection accuracy through parameter optimization and
extensive testing, ensuring the solutionâ€™s scalability and resilience against real-world
attack scenarios.

4. Directed the end-to-end lifecycle of the solution, from planning to extensive testing
in simulated real-time environments, validating its robustness against real-world
attack scenarios.
